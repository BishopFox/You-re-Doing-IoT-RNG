@par Overview
  - Application description
    - http_client_retrieve is a reference application to demonstrate how to
      download a large object in segments.
  - Application features
    - This application explain how to:
    - 1. Connect to the HTTP server.
    - 2. Send HTTP GET request to the HTTP server.
    - 3. Retrieve HTTP response from the HTTP server.
    - 4. Close the HTTP connection.
  - Results
    - The output is in a log.

@par Hardware and software environment
  - Supported platform
    - LinkIt 7697 HDK.
  - Environment configuration
    - The output logs are communicated through a micro-USB cable to the PC
      from USB (CON5) connector on the HDK.
      - Install the mbed serial driver according to the instructions at
        https://developer.mbed.org/handbook/Windows-serial-configuration. For
        more information, please refer to section "Installing the LinkIt 7697
        HDK drivers on Microsoft Windows" on the "LinkIt 7697 HDK User Guide"
        in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - Use a type-A to micro-B USB cable to connect type-A USB of the PC and
        MK20 micro-B USB connector on the LinkIt 7697 HDK. For more
        information about the connector cable, please refer to
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/USB#Mini_and_micro_connectors.
      - Launch a terminal emulator program, such as Tera terminal on your PC
        for data logging through UART. For the installation details, please
        refer to section "Installing Tera terminal on Microsoft Windows" on
        the "LinkIt for RTOS Get Started Guide" in [sdk_root]/doc folder.
      - COM port settings. baudrate: 115200, data bits: 8, stop bit: 1,
        parity: none and flow control: off.
      - Configure a Wi-Fi router with the SSID as SQA_TEST_AP, password as
        77777777 and authentication mode as WPA_PSK_WPA2_PSK. The Wi-Fi
        router should have internet connection.
      - You can change the default settings in main.c to match the SSID and
        password of the existing Wi-Fi Access Point.

@par Run the application
  - Build the application with a command "./build.sh linkit7697_hdk
    http_client_retrieve" from the SDK root folder and download the binary
    file to LinkIt 7697 HDK.
  - Connect the HDK to the PC with a micro-USB cable.
  - Run the application. The result is displayed in the log. "example project
    test success" printed in the log indicates the operation completed
